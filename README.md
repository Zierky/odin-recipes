This project is a simple recipe website built as part of the Odin Project to strengthen my HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page that links to several individual recipe pages. Each recipe page contains essential elements such as an image, description, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions for making the dish. The project focuses on structuring content properly with HTML, creating links between pages, and organizing files and directories effectively.

Reflecting on this project, I feel it was a valuable exercise in solidifying my understanding of HTML structure, especially in creating and linking multiple pages. By working through the iterations, I gained experience in setting up basic content elements like headings, lists, and images, as well as organizing a project directory. Though the website looks basic at this stage, it was important to focus on the functionality and structure first. I look forward to revisiting this project in the future to enhance it with CSS styling and further improve the design.

One thing I would do differently if I could go back is write commit messages for each of the 4 iterations. I realize the importance of documenting the progress at each stage of a project to track changes. Though this project was straight forward enough, it would have been beneficial to practice writing concise commit messages throughout the development process.
